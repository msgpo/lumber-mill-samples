#Lumber Mill Samples Project

Samples for <https://github.com/sonyxperiadev/lumber-mill>

We are working on provided more samples dealing with Cloudwatch, S3 and Kinesis and we also want them to come with good deployment support with as little config changes as possible.

## Stream from cloudwatch logs to Elasticsearch

To get at least one sample out, this really simple Cloudwatch Logs to Elasticsearch lambda can be easliy built and then deployed using AWS Console. Checkout README.md in lumbermill-samples-lambda to get started.

This sample can easily be enriched with grok support etc once you have it deployed.
